** What is this all about?

This is my first attempt at a sway version of my regular Regolith setup. If you've not checked out [[https://regolith-desktop.com/][Regolith]] please do so - it's i3 on Ubuntu.

Here is what 'my' Sway looks like:

#+attr_html: :alt  :align center :width 300px

I received a test laptop from our work supplier. It's a Lenovo ThinkPad P16s. Initial boot had some issues with the laptop lid and resume (i.e. when I closed the lid the laptop screen would turn off but not wake up after suspend resumed)

#+begin_src
sudo dmidecode -s bios-version
#+end_src

If the response is less than 1.30/1.10 then I recommend upgrading.

The fix for this was to [[https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-p-series-laptops/thinkpad-p16s-gen-1-type-21bt-21bu/21bt/21bt000vuk/pf3z0wnh/downloads/driver-list/component?name=BIOS%2FUEFI][update the BIOS]]. Lenovo released a new version on 22nd December 2022 which addressed this issue and some others for Linux.

**   Themes

I've been using Doom Emacs recently and got inspiration from a built in theme 'doom-shades-of-purple'. I've tried to link the colour and theme to all the features added below. This is very much WIP and I will continue as I test the device.

*** TODO [[https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel][Fuzzel]]

Fuzzel does what it needs to do and is styled like the rest of the theme using the colors of shades-of-purple.

*** TODO [[https://github.com/emersion/mako][Mako]]

Mako is an alternative to Dunst/Rofication. I use [[https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst][Dunst]] in my Regolith set up which works really well. Mako is just as cusomisable. I amended my config file to include all the parameters from the man page so I can build it out in time. Keen to explore the menu option.

*** TODO [[https://swaywm.org/][Sway]]

Added many Regolith keybindings and some more nice to haves - like switch to window resize (mod+r) and arrows for resize plus hold shift for a bigger jump.

*** TODO [[https://github.com/swaywm/swaylock][Swaylock]]

Styled a bit, but more a WIP. Want to add Sway logo or something on the screen. At the moment it just blurrs and has a themed purple log in ring.

*** TODO [[https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar][Waybar]]

    Waybar is a really cool, sway specific equivalent to something like [[https://polybar.github.io/][Polybar]]. I really like Waybar and using CSS to style it. This is different to Polybar which feels it has a higher entry level for tweaking.

*** TODO Plymouth theme

    I amended the theme to remove the Fedora logo on the splash screen (spinner theme) in favour of the Sway logo:

    note: You will need to check the current theme and replace anything after /themes/ below.

    #+begin_src
    sudo mv /usr/share/plymouth/themes/theme/currentlogo.png /usr/share/themes/theme/currentlogo.png.bac
    sudo cp /path/to/logo.png /usr/share/plymouth/themes/theme/nameofcurrentlogo.png

    # Then refresh the theme:
    plymouth-set-default-theme -R theme
    #+end_src
